This is 1 of a 2 part System that allows you to find the position of a robot within a room. The other half is an infrared transmitting beacon (IPS TX). The IPS has two cameras that alternate frames. One camera has a normal lens with an Infrared blocking filter and the other has an infrared sensitive lens with a daylight blocking filter.
